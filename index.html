              <p>I started my coding learning journey in December 2023.  I began with YouTube tutorials from <a target="_blank "href="https://www.youtube.com/@SuperSimpleDev">SuperSimpleDev</a></p>
              <p>The first course I started with was his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc" target="_blank">HTML & CSS Full Course - Beginner to Pro</a></p>
              <p>From there, I advanced to his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBmSRK3feww" target="_blank">JavaScript Full Course - Beginner to Pro</a></p>

          <h1>Introduction to Scrimba</h1>
          <p>After I completed both of SuperSimpleDev's great tutorials, I was a bit unsure of where to proceed.  That's when I stumbled upon Scrimba and their <a href="https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend" target="_blank">Frontend Developer Career Path.</a></p>
          <p>I fell in love with Scrimba's interactive learning experience, and as of January 2024, I am about halfway done with the career path.</p>
